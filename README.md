# SpyCrab Industries 'Wooden' Railroad Tracks

Tired of not having that one special piece to complete your layout?

Annoyed by the lack of geometric optimization from commercial systems?

Disapointed that your wooden toys are not made of thermoplastic like everything else in this god forsaken world?

Boy, do I have the solution for you!

**This is a collection of 3d printable toy train tracks compatible with most popular brands**

These desgined are heavily based on the work of Dave Barber's "Observations on Track for Toy Trains." & "A 36-degree system for toy train track" http://tamivox.org/dave/train/index.html. Without his work such a mathematically perfect set of toy train tracks would not exist. 

## Goals:

- Provide a easily accessible collection of 3d printed to train tracks.  
- Provide resorces for the development of these tracks and accompanying documentation.

## To Do:

- Track SVGs for inkscape 
- Update FreeCAD files
- Exsplain 36 deg system
- 222R 36 degree Y
- parallel by 144
- Duble track sections
